# Write a shell script finder-app/finder.sh as described below:
# - Accepts the following runtime arguments: the first argument is a path to a directory on the filesystem, referred to below as filesdir; 
# the second argument is a text string which will be searched within these files, referred to below as searchstr
# - Exits with return value 1 error and print statements if any of the parameters above were not specified
# - Exits with return value 1 error and print statements if filesdir does not represent a directory on the filesystem
# - Prints a message "The number of files are X and the number of matching lines are Y" where X is the number of files in the directory and
# all subdirectories and Y is the number of matching lines found in respective files, where a matching line refers to a line which contains searchstr 
# (and may also contain additional content).
